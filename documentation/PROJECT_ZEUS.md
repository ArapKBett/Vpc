# PROJECT ZEUS: AEGIS-SHIELD Security Whitepaper

## Executive Summary
AEGIS-SHIELD represents a quantum leap in network and cloud security architecture, combining:
- Post-quantum cryptography
- Neural network-based intrusion detection
- Adaptive deception technology
- Automated resilience validation
- Real-time threat intelligence fusion

## Architectural Overview

### Quantum-Resistant Foundation
- Lattice-based cryptographic algorithms (CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium)
- Hybrid key exchange (X25519 + Kyber768)
- Zero-trust microsegmentation

### Neural Sentinel AI Defense
- Transformer-based anomaly detection (F1-score: 0.98)
- Adversarial training with GAN-generated attacks
- Real-time behavioral analysis (50,000 EPS throughput)

### Phantom Maze Deception Grid
- 150+ deception nodes across all network segments
- Dynamic credential generation
- Attack pattern learning system

## Cryptographic Implementation
| Algorithm          | Purpose                     | Security Level |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| Kyber-768          | Key Exchange                | NIST L3        |
| Dilithium-3        | Digital Signatures          | NIST L3        |
| AES-256-GCM        | Data Encryption             | Top Secret     |
| SHA3-384           | Hashing                     | NIST L5        |

## Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: <2ms added for quantum encryption
